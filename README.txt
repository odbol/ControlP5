ControlP5 - GUI for Processing
Originally by Andreas Schlegel, modified by Tyler Freeman

This is a fork of Andreas Schlegel's ControlP5 library for creating GUI elements in Processing.
Changes include concessions for more complicated object oriented designs, giving options to skip the 
reflection events that are in ControlP5 by default.

This may not be backwards compatible.
